# Pull and save Windows 10 login backgrounds #

So, I really like a lot of the backgrounds that show up on the Windows 10 login
screen, and I was getting bummed that they were ephemeral. It turns out though,
that they're buried deeply in your user folder as relatively randomly-named 
images! So I made this small script to pull the files to a different location,
give them the right suffix, and hang on only to those in landscape orientation.

## TODO ##
1. Get the version I already have to work on this machine
2. Figure out how to schedule it?
3. Run at login?
